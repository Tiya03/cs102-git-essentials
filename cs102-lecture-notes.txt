							SUMMARY
In the class we first learnt how to set up a ssh key using ssh-keygen commands. We created a public - private key pair.
Then we added this public key to our GitHub account so that our local machine is uniquely recognised as the owner of 
this GitHub account thus giving our local machine all owner permissions. One key was set up we tried cloning repository
without the use of "GitHub Desktop" application and using git commands. Further we used more github commands in Ubuntu 
to create a file, add it to the repository, commit the changes and finally pushing all the changes made in local machine
to the server. We also made changes in the server and pulled the changes to local machine thus updating both GitHubs.
